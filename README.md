#### Problem Statement: The ACB needs an efficient way to streamline their event scheduling and event participation processes. 

#### Our Solution: We created a web application using React.js, Node.js, and Firebase to enable users to sign up / sign in and view a list of available, approved events, personalized to their interests. They also have the ability to suggest an event that they would like to host. Further, we developed an efficient way for admin to log in and take note of the suggested events that they need to approve as well as the list of available, approved events, personalized to their interests.
